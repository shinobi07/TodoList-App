# Task Reminder

## Introduction

Task Reminder is a todo-list application started out as a course project, developed and deployed as a side project.

## Functionality

Task Reminder has almost all the functionalities that you would expect from a todo-list application. From creating a new task, deleting complete tasks, to setting a timer and alarms going off when the time hits.

For the backend, I used NodeJS and the library [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) to create a full fake REST API without the need of any database.
